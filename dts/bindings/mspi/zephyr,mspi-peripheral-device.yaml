  Generic MSPI peripheral device. This node describes a device on the MSPI bus
  that is a peripheral (e.g. another SoC in peripheral mode, or an external peripheral).
  The local MSPI controller is the master; this node describes the peripheral
  it talks to. Use for SoC-to-SoC links, or any application-defined peripheral with no
  dedicated Zephyr driver.
